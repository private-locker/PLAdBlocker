# PLAdBlocker

We at Private-Locker noticed some shady business in the Miner Program World. 

So as a result, we have released a AdBlocker(Main HOSTS from MVP) and few other Custom
Blocks for Miners Dev-Fee's. - Until they give a fair Share-submit rate/count, or fix 
their Donation section of their miners.

PLAdBlocker Blocks these Dev Fee's:
 - XMRig Dev Fee
 - XMRigCC Dev Fee
 - XMR-Stak Dev Fee

PLAdBlocker also Blocks Ads using:
 - MVP HOSTS File
 - MinerGate AdBlock URL

## If you want to submit other URL's/Domains to be Blocked, submit a commit request.
