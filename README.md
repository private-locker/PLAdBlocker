# PLAdBlocker

We at Private-Locker noticed some shady business in the Miner Program World. 

So as a result, we have released a AdBlocker(Main HOSTS from MVPS) and few other Custom
Blocks for Miners Dev-Fee's. - Until they give a fair Share-submit rate/count, or fix 
their Donation section of their miners.

Installation Instructions:
```sh
1. Go to the Project Release Page and download the Current Version. 
   https://github.com/private-locker/PLAdBlocker/releases

2. Unzip the contents of the Zip File into a desired Folder.

3. Run "PLAdBlocker.cmd" by double-clicking on it.

4. Click "Yes" to allow the File Administrator Access to be able to block unneeded Ads.

5. Use the prompt to install/update your PC.
   - When loading up the program, you will notice -
   " !! There is NO HOSTS File in this script! !!
  !! Please [U]pdate to Download a new copy of the HOSTS File. !! ", Press u and hit Enter.
   - After that process is done, Press i to "Install PLAdBlocker" and follow the prompts.

6. Restart your PC and ENJOY!  
```

 - XMRig Dev Fee
